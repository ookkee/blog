Hi, I'm ookkee. I work as a security specialist at Nixu. During my spare time I
sometimes hack for fun in various CTF's and
[HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/). This blog is for posting CTF writeups and
other stuff I've learned. Maybe I'll post about other subjects than hacking/ICT as
well, who knows?

Here's a picture of Whistler from the awesome 1992 movie Sneakers:
